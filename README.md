# Rewarded NFTs Marketplace
**Project Idea `Pablo Palomo`**

The project consists of the creation of an ERC-721 contract that will send the collected amount of minting NFTs to stake. This way, every month, generated interests will be shared through NFT owners. But... how?

User will mine assets of two types depending on how lucky they are:
1. **Standard NFTs** These are normal NFT images randomnly generated without extra capabilities.
2. **Special NFTs** These are rare an unusual NFTs with some interesting capabilities. A random weight between 1 and 1000 which means the percentage of interests that can be withdrawn every month.

**Workflow:** 
1. A user mints a new NFT which is generated randomly.
2. The collected amount will be sent to stake. This stake will generate interests every month.
3. The NFT created can be either a Standard NFT or a Special NFT.
5. Special NFTs give the owner the right to withdraw monthly a percentage of the interest generated depending on the weight of the NFT. Standard NFTs will have a zero weight.
6. The weight of an Special NFT can grow every month (when withdraw). This way the older owners will benefit from keeping his NFTs. 
7. NFT weight is related to an owner. If the owner changes, the weight will be reset to original weight.
8. Project contributors will earn a percentage of the interests as a fee. Every contributor will have a weight related to the amount of work he has done.

**Objectives:** 
1. Bring something new to the exciting world of NFTs.
2. Benefit owners to keep their NTFs and thus raise their price.
